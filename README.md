# volume-control-using-hand-gesture
This volume control module uses hand tracking to adjust the system volume. It detects the distance between the thumb and index finger to control the volume level, and adjusts it based on hand gestures. You can mute or change the volume using finger positions, making it a hands-free solution for controlling audio.
